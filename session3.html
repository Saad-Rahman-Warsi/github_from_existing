 		There was a <em>time</em> when people <i>belived</i> that <u>organic compounds</u> could only be <b>synthesized by living organisms</b> by vital forces. This theory was known as <sup>vital force theory</sup>. However there was a <ins>time</ins> when <small>first organic compound</small> urea NH<SUB>2</SUB>CONH<SUB>2</sub>was sucessfully synthesized which is found in living organism in urine Several other organic compounds were <del>synthesuzed</del>synthesized This gave a blow to vital force theory
